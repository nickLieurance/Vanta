## Key activities

I’d audit all existing integrations education (articles, courses, and training) to understand quality, technical accuracy, and discoverability. I’d also review the top integration-related support tickets to see what users struggle with most.

## Why this matters

Fragmented content and inconsistent depth increase ticket volume and slow down adoption. By assessing what exists and what’s missing, I can create a prioritized roadmap that focuses on the integrations that cause the most friction for customers and Support.

## Quick wins

- Update or archive the highest-volume inaccurate articles.
- Identify the three integrations with the biggest user pain points.
- Produce a short summary of cross-channel gaps (Help Center vs. Academy vs. Training).

## How I’d measure progress

1. Publish a content audit focused on accuracy, duplication, and structure.
2. Complete a heuristic evaluation for the top integrations.
3. Deliver a prioritized list of content updates tied to user impact.
