## Key activities

I’d start by talking with partners across Customer Success, Design, Engineering, Product, and Support. These conversations would help me understand how integrations ship today, what breaks down, and where education fits into release cycles. I’d also document the current workflow for creating integration content across the Help Center, Academy, and Training.

## Why this matters

Integrations move quickly. If education sits outside the release process, content becomes outdated, inconsistent, or duplicated. Understanding how teams work and where gaps appear creates the foundation for a predictable, scalable program.

## Quick wins

- Create a simple “who to talk to for each integration” directory.
- Build a draft release-aligned workflow that partners can react to.
- Host a short working session to surface the biggest friction points across teams.

## How I’d measure progress

#### Milestones

1. Complete stakeholder conversations across key teams.
2. [Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yhXqucm9JcdG2f71_fHS_ka7R7rYVHrW/view?usp=sharing) the current integrations release process end-to-end.
3. Deliver a draft workflow for review that shows how education plugs into releases.
