## Key activities

I’d create the foundational systems we need to keep education clear, consistent, and scalable. This includes style guidance specific to integrations, a glossary of key terms, and templates that help internal teams contribute without reinventing the wheel.

## Why this matters

A shared language reduces confusion and ensures users have a familiar, predictable experience across channels. It also helps internal teams avoid creating duplicate materials and makes AI-driven deflection more effective.

## Quick wins

- Build a lightweight glossary for the most-used integrations terms.
- Publish a simple article template that Support and Product teams can use.
- Draft guidelines that set expectations for depth, tone, and accuracy.
