## 1. Explore the problem space.
- Interview contributors across Education, Engineering, Product, and Support. 
- Observe real integration releases and content creation workflows.
- Audit tools, documentation sources, and handoff points.

**Output:** A current-state workflow map showing ownership, gaps, and friction points.
## 2. Translate findings into insights.

- Build lightweight personas for internal contributors and end users.
- Map journeys for content creation and content use.
- Identify the top breakdowns by frequency and impact.

**Output:** A summary of pain points + opportunities, prioritized by user impact.
## 3. Brainstorm solutions.
- Co-create ideas with partners during a short workshop.
- Explore options for improving communication, ownership, and content quality.
- Define what “good” looks like for integrations education.

**Output:** A shortlist of solutions with effort estimates and expected outcomes.

## 4. Prototype one solution.
- Select one idea with the highest impact-to-effort ratio.
- Build a working version (e.g., template, workflow, guidelines, structure model).
- Run it with a small set of integrations content.

**Output:** A functional pilot that partners can use and react to in real workflows.
## 5. Test and iterate.
- Collect feedback from Product, Support, and other internal contributors.
- Track early signals like reduced rework or faster updates.
- Improve based on what we learn.

**Output:** A refined, scalable solution ready for broader rollout.
