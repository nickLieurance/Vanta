Integrations content lives across multiple channels, and teams follow their own processes to create and maintain it. This leads to duplicate articles, uneven depth, and information that’s hard to find. Teams sometimes rebuild content because they don’t know what exists. 

But this isn’t unique to Vanta. Research suggests up to 20% of enterprise content is redundant, costing organizations millions. Users feel this through unclear setup steps and slow troubleshooting.

## What this initiative solves

We need a consistent system for creating, updating, and finding integrations content. This work improves how teams collaborate across channels and turns our first 90 days of insights into a scalable, long-term solution.
