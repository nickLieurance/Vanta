I would track indicators that show whether integrations content reduces friction, increases self-service, and improves product understanding.

| KPI                                    | What it tells us                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integration-related ticket volume      | Are users finding answers on their own?                     |
| Deflection rate (AI + Help Center)     | Is content reducing inbound workload for Support?           |
| Time-to-resolution                     | When users do need help, how quickly can they move forward? |
| Article usefulness / search success    | Are users finding the right content at the right moment?    |
| Activation + adoption metrics          | Are integrations easier to set up and maintain?             |
| User + agent feedback (UMUX Lite, NPS) | How does the content experience feel?                       |

These metrics give us insight into both efficiency (fewer tickets, faster resolution) and experience (confidence, ease of use).
