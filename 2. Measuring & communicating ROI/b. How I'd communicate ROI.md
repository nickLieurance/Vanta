To make progress visible, I’d set baselines first. Then I’d track trends month over month.

### How I’d measure impact:

- Pull support ticket data filtered by integration-related keywords.
- Track search interactions, page exits, and article feedback in the Help Center.
- Partner with Product to monitor activation and setup success.
- Run lightweight agent and customer surveys to identify friction.

### How I’d share results:

- A [living dashboard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ruc-gLcH7-8FbsHLrskONP52gxVkSPrh/view?usp=sharing) with trends and deltas, not one-off reports.
- Monthly Slack updates with three things: what improved, what stalled, and what’s next.
- Quarterly readout with leadership that connects results to business outcomes.

### How I’d frame impact to leadership:

“Support tickets related to integrations dropped 18% this quarter. Our content and troubleshooting improvements are helping customers solve problems without escalating to Support.”

“Time to resolution decreased by 2.5 hours for our top three integrations. Updated docs and workflows allowed agents to resolve issues faster.”
