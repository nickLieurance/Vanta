Take-Home Assignment - Integrations Education Transformation - Nick Lieurance

---

### Scenario
You are the new Program Manager for Technical Education, focused on Integrations within Vanta’s Customer Education organization. Vanta’s integrations ecosystem is growing quickly, yet customer-facing education across our Help Center, Academy, and Training programs has developed organically over time, resulting in content that is inconsistent in depth, tone, and discoverability and internal teams often recreate materials to fill gaps.

Your goal is to show how you would transform integrations education into a unified, scalable, and measurable program that improves customer adoption and reduces support volume.

### Instructions

#### First 90 Days: Priorities

What are the three most important priorities you would focus on in your first 90 days? For each priority, explain why it matters, what success looks like, and how you’d ensure measurable progress.

Consider factors like:
- Content consistency and technical accuracy 
- Alignment with Product and Engineering release cycles
- Cross-channel content strategy (Help Center, Academy, Training)
- Internal enablement and AI-driven ticket deflection
- Quick wins that demonstrate visible impact

#### Measuring & Communicating ROI

How would you measure the ROI of integrations-focused education and demonstrate its business value to leadership? Which metrics would you track?

For example:
- Reduced integration-related support tickets
- Increased AI/self-service deflection
- Time-to-resolution improvements
- Customer adoption or activation metrics

Explain why these metrics matter, how you would track and report them, and how you’d communicate progress to executives or cross-functional partners.

#### Long-Term Initiative (6–12+ Months)

Recommend one long-term initiative that would evolve Vanta’s integrations education into a more strategic, scalable pillar of Customer Education.

Examples could include:
- Developing a modular integrations curriculum within Vanta Academy
- Launching interactive troubleshooting flows within the Help Center
- Creating AI-powered internal enablement tools for Support
- Implementing a release-aligned documentation and training workflow with Product and Engineering

Describe the business impact this initiative would drive and how you would gain alignment across teams to execute it.

**Format**

Please submit your response as a short doc, slide deck, or format of your choice, whatever best illustrates your thought process. Focus on clarity, prioritization, and business impact. We’re not looking for a full-blown strategy document, just a thoughtful, structured overview that demonstrates how you’d approach owning and scaling this program.

**What We’re Looking For**

- Strategic thinking around technical education and integrations enablement
- Ability to balance near-term execution with long-term scalability
- Data-driven mindset with clear ROI storytelling
- Strong understanding of cross-functional collaboration (EPD, Support, Enablement)
- Clear communication and customer-first perspective
